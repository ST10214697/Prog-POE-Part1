Recipe Program

My program will start by showing the user the main menu.
From the main menu the user can choose between 6 options.
Since it is a recipe program, the first option allows the user to enter their recipe details.
The user will specify how many ingredients are neede to make their recipe.
Then proceed to enter the ingredients needed, their quanties and their unit of measurements.
From there the program will aask the user how many steps is required to prepare the recipe.
You will then enter details for each step mentioned.
The program will store all the information and direct u back to the main menu.
From there you can then choose options from displaying the recipe in a appropriate format to clearing your recipe details.
You can choose to scale your recipe by half, double or triple and the program will calcute the quantities accordingly.
You can decide to reset the quantities to their original value and the program will do that for you automatically.
After you have entered your recipe details and made neccessary adjustments then u can proceed to exiting the program with all you recipe details intact.
